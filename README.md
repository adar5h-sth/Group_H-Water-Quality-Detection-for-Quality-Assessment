# Water Quality Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project is an Arduino-based IoT system designed to monitor water quality by measuring turbidity levels. The system provides real-time feedback on water clarity and alerts users when turbidity exceeds safe thresholds. While a turbidity sensor would be used in a real-world setup, an Ambient Light Sensor (Phototransistor) is used in Tinkercad to approximate turbidity for the simulation.

## Components
- **Arduino UNO**: The central microcontroller that reads data from the sensor and controls the display and buzzer.
- **Turbidity Sensor**: Used in real hardware to detect water turbidity based on light scattering (in Tinkercad, an Ambient Light Sensor is used as a substitute).
- **Ambient Light Sensor (Phototransistor)**: Simulates turbidity in Tinkercad by measuring light levels to represent water clarity.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Displays the turbidity level and water quality status in real-time.
- **Buzzer**: Provides an audible alert when water turbidity levels are high, indicating poor water quality.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: Used for wiring components and creating the circuit.
- **Resistors**: Regulates current within the circuit for stable operation.
